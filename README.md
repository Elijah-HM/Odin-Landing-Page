# Odin-Landing-Page
For this project I created a web page based on a design provided by THE ODIN PROJECT. The Odin Project provided a screenshot of the layout and what color should be used but it must be made based on the skills I've learned so far in the course.

This project almost caused me to rage quit learning how to code. The html part is simple but styling the flexbox almost aged me 20 years. This project took me 1 day to complete. It's not the best but I know if I keep at it I will get better.
